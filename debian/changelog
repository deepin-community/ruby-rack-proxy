ruby-rack-proxy (0.6.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Sergio Durigan Junior ]
  * Prevent testcases that access the internet to run.
    Some testcases (test/http_streaming_response_test.rb and
    test/rack_proxy_test.rb) try to access the internet, but that is
    against Debian Policy guidelines, and therefore we need to disable
    them. (Closes: #860198)
